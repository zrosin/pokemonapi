How to use:

` npm run init ` -- Initializes the database with the Kanto Pokedex. Unnecessary for running the mocha tests, but you may want to before trying the index.html file.

`npm start` -- Runs server with all routes on http://localhost:8000/api/pokemon/. Initializes with 150 pokemon. These pokemon are overwritten every time npm start is called. Browse to http://localhost:8000/ to get to index.html.

`npm test` -- Runs test script. Displays results in console.
