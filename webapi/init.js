// The all new and improved dataset was provided by the lovely veekun/pokedex project on GitHub, which consists of a bunch of CSV files full of data dumped from the games.
// I brought that into SQLite, figured out how they setup their data (which is a lot of fun with no documentation) and cut it down to the test data we'd need.
// (The data was in 3NF, and I didn't completely denormalize, so Mongo isn't running as fast as it would like. Oh well.)
// That project is licensed under the MIT License, but of course the contents (but not the formats) of the files are (c) Nintendo/Creatures/Game Freak.
