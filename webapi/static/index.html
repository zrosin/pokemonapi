        <h1>Hello there!</h1>
        <p>The Pokemon API is running. Woo-hoo! But you didn't copy a React build into the static folder, so instead of a nice interface, you got this instead.</p>
        <p>If you have Docker installed, run docker-compose up from the root of the project, or else, just copy the files in here. Please?</p>
